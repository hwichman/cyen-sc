# SWANS

This is a READ ME file for our Senior Capstone project at LA Tech - Spring 2020. 
The project consists of a Secure Wireless Network System using a Python-based App, multiple sensors and ECC Encryption. 

The project consists of a cost effective alternative to the existing monitoring systems in chemical plants and/or oil refineries in a secured manner. The purpose of the project is to monitor some sort of chemmical in a reservoir, gather data, parse and encrypt the data and send it to the App to be monitored. 

SWANS will be running ECC Encryption since it is lightweight and power friendly. 

On the App, the user will be able to specify parameteres depending on the chemical properties. 
This parameteres will be divided into 3 categories:
1. Green -- data is within the parameters
2. Yellow -- data is close to surpassing the paramters
3. Red -- data is out of the parameters

After having successfully received the data on the App, the user will be able to see data in real time and monitor different properties at once.
